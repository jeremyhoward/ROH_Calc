# ROH_Calc

The ROH_Calc is a program that determines whether a region of the genome for an individual is in a ROH of a given length. The program reads in a parameter file that provides the location of necessary files along with quality control parameters. The program utilizes a sliding window approach and searches for stretches of continuous homozygous genotypes. The program output the proportion of the genome in an ROH, if a window or SNP is in a ROH across the genome for each individual.
